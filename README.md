##🚕 NYC Taxi Trips Data Analytics & Machine Learning Project

This project is an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning solution built using the NYC Taxi Trips dataset to demonstrate skills in big data processing, machine learning, business intelligence, and natural language processing (NLP). The project is divided into four structured tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of real-world data analysis.

📌 Task 1: Big Data Analysis using PySpark

The first task focuses on performing analysis on a large-scale dataset (approximately 500MB) using PySpark, showcasing scalability and big data handling capabilities. The raw NYC Taxi Trips dataset contains trip-level information such as pickup and dropoff timestamps, passenger count, trip distance, fare details, and payment type.
In this task, the dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, correcting data types (timestamps, numerical fields), removing invalid records, and creating derived columns such as pickup hour and day of week. Using PySpark transformations and aggregations, key insights such as trip distribution by hour, average trip distance, and revenue trends are derived. The deliverable is a PySpark notebook that demonstrates efficient big data processing and analytical insights.

📌 Task 2: Machine Learning Model for Fare Prediction

The second task involves building a machine learning regression model to predict taxi fare amounts. Using the cleaned dataset from Task 1, relevant features such as trip distance, passenger count, and trip duration are selected. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a regression model is trained using standard machine learning techniques.
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and R² score, and the results are interpreted to understand prediction accuracy. This task demonstrates feature selection, model training, evaluation, and interpretation, with the complete workflow presented in a Jupyter/Colab notebook.

📌 Task 3: Interactive Dashboard using Power BI

In Task 3, insights from data analysis and machine learning are visualized using Power BI. A single, comprehensive interactive dashboard is created by integrating the cleaned dataset, aggregated insights, and ML prediction outputs.
The dashboard includes KPIs, demand analysis, revenue analysis, predictive insights, funnel chart, gauge chart, and map visualizations. Interactive slicers such as pickup hour, passenger count, payment type, and trip distance allow dynamic exploration of data. The dashboard provides actionable business insights related to demand patterns, revenue optimization, and predictive fare estimation.

📌 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis using NLP

The final task demonstrates sentiment analysis on textual data using NLP techniques. Since the original taxi dataset does not contain text data, a synthetic reviews column is added to simulate customer feedback. Text preprocessing steps such as cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal are applied, followed by TF-IDF feature extraction.
A classification model is trained to categorize reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The notebook showcases preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and sentiment-based insights.
